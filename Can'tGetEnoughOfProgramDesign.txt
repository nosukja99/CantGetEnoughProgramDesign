Every day, a researcher receives 15 measurements. 
He needs a program written that will accept each measurement and convert it to its metric equivalent. 
The result shall display on the monitor. 
After all 15 measurements are entered, the words "All measurements processed" shall be displayed on the screen.

ALGORITHM : Accept each measurement and convert it to its metric equivalent only 15 measurements. 
            After 15, display "All measurements processed" 
	
	===================================
	INPUT : measurement

	PROCESSING STEPS : Change to metric equivalent

	OUTPUTS : metricMeasurement

	=================================
	1. DOWHILE   PSEUDOCODE :    Initialize measurement to zero
								 Initialize numOfMe to zero
								 Initialize metricMeasurement to zero
								 
								 
								 Prompt user input a measurement 
								 Get a measurement
								 DoWhile numOfMe is less than 15
								 Convert to metricMeasurement
								 Display metricMeasurement
								 increase one to numOfMe
								 EndDo
								 
								 Display "All measurements processed"
						 
	2. REPEAT...UNTIL  PSEUDOCODE :  Initialize measurement to zero
									 Initialize numOfMe to zero
									 Initialize metricMeasurement to zero
									 
									 
									 REPEAT 
									 Prompt user input a measurement 
									 Get a measurement
									 Convert to metricMeasurement
									 Display metricMeasurement
									 increase one to numOfMe
									 UNTIL numOfMe is 15
									 
									 Display "All measurements processed"
						 
						 
	3. Counted repetition  PSEUDOCODE :  Initialize measurement to zero
										 Initialize numOfMe to zero
										 Initialize metricMeasurement to zero
							 
							 
							 DO Initialize loop-index i to zero 
							    Increments the loop-index by 1 for each pass through the loop-index
								Prompt user input a measurement 
							    Get a measurement
							    Convert to metricMeasurement
							    Display metricMeasurement
								Tests the loop-index value is greater than 15
								ENDDO
						
							 Display "All measurements processed"
